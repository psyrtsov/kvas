<h3>Writing data:</h3>
<OL>
	<LI>
        When data change request comes to Client&nbsp;API&nbsp;it stores changed data in Temp Storage.
        Also change request gets stored to Persistent Queue.
	<LI>
    	Queue Processing Job gets queued update and applies it to data in persistent storage.
</OL>

<h3>Reading data:</h3>
<OL>
	<LI>
	    Read request comes to DB Client&nbsp;API&nbsp;, it checks if data for this request available in Temp Storage.
        If it is then use it, otherwise go to Persistent Store.
</OL>
This approach allows to write to distributed DB with speed of writing to persistent queue, which is usually way faster then DB updates. And
read can be easily scaled by adding additional replicas.

Potential issues with this design.
<OL>

	Temp Storage eventually will start overflowing. It`s hard to get
	memcached storage capacity as big as Persistent Storage capacity.
	When it happens DB Client going to fallback to Persistent DB for
	records that been pushed out of Temp Storage, we need to make sure
	that Queue Processing is done for the matching queued records.

	<LI>
	Temp Storage based on memcached is not that reliable and if it goes down
	we might loose data consistency for short period of time until
	current data in queue will be propagated to persistent DB. It`s
	reliability can be improved, but let`s look at what might happen in
	this scenario. First thing that will happen is that users will
	temporary loose their changes for records that still in the queue.
	This might not be that bad considering it&rsquo;ll happen just for
	short period of time. But if user that already had change waiting in
	the queue in that moment will submit yet another change to system it
	might lead to situation wen change will be permanently lost.
	<LI>
	This design relies very heavily on Queue Processing job to be reliable
	and fast enough. So it should be well designed. On other hand this
	design allows Queue Processing job to be temporarily stopped (for
	some maintenance tasks) without affecting end user. That is as long
	as Temporary storage is big enough and job is fast enough to catch
	up with queued changes later.
	<LI>
	Any key value storage this design has difficulty dealing with concurrent
	updates in same record.&nbsp;<BR>Amazon Dynamo solves this problem
	at price of eventual consistency. Design in discussion allows to
	approach this problem differently: If we use user id as part of they
	key when we store data in memcached we can isolate changes so that
	user can see only changes made by that user, and when queue
	processing for that job is done and change is merged into persistent
	DB we&rsquo;ll have to expire record in memcached.
